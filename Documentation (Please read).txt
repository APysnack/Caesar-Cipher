This program was designed to be ran from the command line.

command line arguments (-i, -o, -e, -d, -r)

-----------------------------------
Part 1. 

If you choose not to enter any of these arguments, the program will prompt the user for english words to be translated into Swedish. (e.g. "Merry Christmas") 

(These English words must be contained in the Python Dictionary)

-----------------------------------
Part 2. 

If you do choose to use these arguments, the program will either encode or decode a caesarian cipher by taking the text from an input file and writing the encoded/decoded text into an output file.

- i: the name of the input file (e.g. -i input.txt)
- o: the name of the output file (e.g. -o output.txt)
- e: type this if you wish to encode
- d: type this if you wish to decode
- r: the number of shifts desired (e.g. -r 13 is rot-13). If no input for -r is selected, it defaults to 13.


sample input for encoding rot-13: Python J00643490_Lab4.py -i input.txt -o output.txt -e -r 13

Thank you!
